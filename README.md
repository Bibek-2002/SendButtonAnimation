# Interactive Send Button Animation

This repository contains the source code for an interactive send button that morphs into a paper plane and follows a predefined path, beautifully demonstrating SVG manipulation and GSAP animations.

## Overview

The project showcases a "Send" button that, upon interaction, transitions through various states using SVG morphing and animated paths. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), including plugins like MorphSVGPlugin and MotionPathPlugin.

## Features

- **SVG Send Button**: Interactive button that morphs into different shapes.
- **GSAP Animation**: Utilizes GSAP for smooth and sophisticated animations.
- **MorphSVGPlugin**: Transforms SVG paths dynamically.
- **MotionPathPlugin**: Animates elements along complex paths.
